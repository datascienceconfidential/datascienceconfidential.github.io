While writing a report recently, I made a series of bar charts like the following one.

```r
dat <- rep(1:5, 2)
barplot(dat, col=rep(c("red", "blue"), each=5))
```
<div style="width:70%; margin:0 auto;">

</div>

Upon review, the colours looked rather harsh, so I decided to convert them to something more soothing and professional-looking. I needed a `pastellize` function, but a search on the internet didn't turn up anything.
This led me to read about [pastel colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_(color)) which Wikipedia describes as

> the family of colors which, when described in the HSV color space, have high value and low to intermediate saturation.

I had vaguely heard of the [HSV colour space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), but this was my first attempt to use it. I 
usually work with rgb values, in which a colour is described by a triple of red, green and blue, with the values of each running from 
0 to 1. In HSV, colours are arranged on a cylinder as in the following picture from the Wikiepdia page.

It seems that pastellizing a colour will be a simple task. First, convert from rgb to HSV. Second, decrease the saturation. Third, 
convert back.

R features a handy `rgb2hsv` function which converts rgb values into HSV values. Unfortunately, in typical R fashion, there is no
`hsv2rgb` function. However, the algorithm for this conversion is described on the Wikipedia page as well, so it can be implemented
in R.

```r
hsv2rgb <- function(x){  
  # convert an hsv colour to rgb  
  # input:  a 3 x 1 matrix (same as output of rgb2hsv() function)  
  # output: vector of length 3 with values in [0,1]    

  # recover h, s, v values  
  h <- x[1,1]  
  s <- x[2,1]  
  v <- x[3,1]    

  # follow the algorithm from Wikipedia  
  C <- s*v   

  # in R, h takes values in [0,1] rather than [0, 360], so dividing by  
  # 60 degrees is the same as multiplying by six  
  hdash <- h*6  
  X <- C * (1 - abs(hdash %% 2 -1))
  
   if (0 <= hdash & hdash <=1) RGB1 <- c(C, X, 0)  
   if (1 <= hdash & hdash <=2) RGB1 <- c(X, C, 0)  
   if (2 <= hdash & hdash <=3) RGB1 <- c(0, C, X)  
   if (3 <= hdash & hdash <=4) RGB1 <- c(0, X, C)  
   if (4 <= hdash & hdash <=5) RGB1 <- c(X, 0, C)  
   if (5 <= hdash & hdash <=6) RGB1 <- c(C, 0, X)    
 
   # the output is a vector of length 3. This is the most convenient  
   # format for using as the col argument in an R plotting function  
   RGB1 + (v-C)
}
```
This function is not as fast or versatile as `rgb2hsv` since it is not vectorized, but it is good enough for now. 

Now here is the pastellizer function.

```r
pastellize <- function(x, p){
  
  # x is a colour
  # p is a number in [0,1]
  # p = 1 will give no pastellization
  
  # convert hex or letter names to rgb
  if (is.character(x)) x <- col2rgb(x)/255
  
  # convert vector to rgb
  if (is.numeric(x)) x <- matrix(x, nr=3)
  
  col <- rgb2hsv(x, maxColorValue=1)
  col[2,1] <- col[2,1]*p
  col <- hsv2rgb(col)
  
  # return in convenient format for plots
  rgb(col[1], col[2], col[3])
}
```
A quick demo, showing what happens when the parameter `p` is varied.

```r
demo <- function(){
  plot(0,0, xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10), type="n", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", bty="n", xlab="", ylab="")
  for (i in 0:9){
    for (j in 10:0){
      rect(i,j-1,i+1,j, col=pastellize(rainbow(10)[i+1], j/10), border=NA)
    }
  }
}

demo()
```
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
 <img src="/blog/images/2017-11/swatches.png" />
</div>

And finally, here is how to use it in a plot. Much more restful!

```r
pastel_red <- pastellize("red", 0.3)
pastel_blue <- pastellize("blue", 0.3)

dat <- rep(1:5, 2)
barplot(dat, col=rep(c(pastel_red, pastel_blue), each=5), border=NA)
# border=NA removes black borders from the bars
```
<div style="width:70%; margin:0 auto;">
 <img src="/blog/images/2017-11/barplot2.png" />
</div>

Happy pastellizing!
