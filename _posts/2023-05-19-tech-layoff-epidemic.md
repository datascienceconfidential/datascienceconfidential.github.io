I recently became very interested in the layoffs which are sweeping through the tech sector. The number of layoffs has been unusually high for a while, but what really got me interested was losing my job and then finding out that the job market is really tough. Fortunately, I was able to find some work in epidemiology which will keep me going for now.

Then I wondered whether I could combine my interest in layoffs with my new interest in epidemiology, and a new paper was born!

The basic idea is to extract data from an online layoff tracker at [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) and then apply an epidemiological model to it.
